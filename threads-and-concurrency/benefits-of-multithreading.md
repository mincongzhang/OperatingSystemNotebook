## Benefits of Multithreading

![](/assets/benefits_of_multithreading.png)

AS: address space
EC: execution context

1.Same code, diff tasks  

2.Hot cache, more efficient, e.g. task1 can execute more often  

3.Why not multi-processing? 

multi-processing doesn't not share address space, 3 extra memory

multi-threading more memory efficient

IPC communication and synchronization more costly
